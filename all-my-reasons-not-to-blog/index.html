But I have always been really good at talking myself out of things. It's a hidden (not actually) sprititual gift of mine. I'm sure it has a purpose somewhere in my life...right? But seriously. These were my thoughts. I give you...all my reasons not to blog aaaand a couple reasons why I decided to anyways.</p><p>Reasons not to actually do a blog:</p><p>1. I don't want to commit to something that I can't maintain. </p><p>I haaaaate it when people start something all gung ho and "hey everyone! This is totally what I'm about" and then they just crap out after a while. (Note- I do NOT have activator in my top five strengths. What's the opposite of activator? I think I have that.) I still haven't really figured out how I'm going to maintain doing entries while being basically maxed out in my life in general but I just decided to stop caring. Because going for it. And stuff.</p><p>2. Sometimes other people's blogs make me feel uncomfortable</p><p>That feeling when someone you know shares their blog on facebook and you read it and go *that emoji face of the "yeesh" face. You know the one I mean.* (Side note- it has obviously been far too long since I've written anything on a legit keyboard because I reached for that emoji and had a slight moment of withdrawl when IT DID NOT EXIST ON MY KEYBOARD. Um, what now?) I mean, this is pretty rare as I have some really stellar blogger friends who do amazing entries. But that odd time that someone's blog makes me feel embarassed for them makes me never want to put myself out there because ahhhhhh all the scared feelings, right?!</p><p>3. I care too much what people think (wait, this may be the same as #2. I'm working on it. It's a thing for me.)</p><p>The way that I worry about criticism from people. It's probably something we all carry a little bit (ok, I just tell myself this. I know some of you don't care what people think and you need to teach me your WAYS) but I just can't handle the thought of having something that people can actually read and critique. But OH WELL. I'm thirty something, man. Time to stop caring, am I right?</p><p>4. Decompartmentalizing my life</p><p> I have my professional self, my self that's all "HERE I AM" with my friends and family, my probably a little more proper self on a Sunday morning, my messy self when I'm breaking it down with a good friend and a glass of wine on a Friday night. I'm a pretty open book individual but even for me, blogging feels strange. As in, how do I blend all these parts of myself into one version that I'm ok sharing with the world? </p><p>Ok I think that might be all my reasons. I'm sure there are more but you get the point- I have all the excuses. I actually got really comfortable with my excuses and my ticking of the "hey I don't do that" box related to blogging. But somehow it KEPT calling my name. It kept coming up in conversations. I love when I share something funny or vulnerable on facebook and people connect with it. It makes me want to have more of a chance to do that in a blog. So here I am. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh. *Scared blushing wide eyed emoji face.* (Note to self- work on relearning your ability to use the English language on a keyboard. You have a University degree, woman. Come on!)</p><p>Reasons to start a blog:</p><p>1. It's time to do something I want to do without worrying about how it's going to turn out. I'm just showing up. SHOWING UP. Hi, here I am. I'm blogging. It might be weird and awkward at first. Actually, I'm pretty sure it's totally weird and awkward. I'll look back on these intial posts and cringe someday after I've hit my groove but oh well! It's just time to dive in and try this.\</p><p>2. Anything I wrote for #2 was really just #1 with different wording. So, I guess it's just that. I need to give myself permission to try something that's uncomfortable, uncharted territory.
