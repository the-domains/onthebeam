# Who am I?

#### I like this analogy: When a parent offers a child some dessert, that child doesn't wrestle with the parent's will the way we often wrestle with the will of God. That child, in innocent relationship, doesn't worry or whine. That child doesn't get anxious. "Oh, what is your will for me, Father? Should I have dessert? Should it be ice cream or cake? I don't want to make the wrong decision? Maybe you are testing me? Maybe you want me to eat more broccoli? Maybe if I choose ice cream I shouldn't choose very much? Or maybe I should say 'no'? But what if I miss an open door of opportunity and I fail to cross the threshold of dessert? Oh, Father, what is your will for me?"
