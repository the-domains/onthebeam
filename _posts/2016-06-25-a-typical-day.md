A Typical Day...

In these verses, David is certain that God's will includes the biblical promise that "God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose" (Romans 8:28). He is sure that God means for his life to be spared, for evil to be defeated, and for his heart to be encouraged._(A lot of times I think we know God's general will for our lives. He's given us direction through his Word on how to stand tall in this world, how to live vibrantly on a daily basis. He has empowered us to persevere through hardship, to grow character and to give hope. He's wired us with unique skills and passions that can be used for his Good News in this world. In his Word and by his actions there is basic blueprint for doing justice and loving mercy when the world around us struggles. We know that Jesus lives for us and we are to live for Jesus.)_

But now look at the end of David's thoughts -- v 14:

> **14 **Wait patiently for the Lord.  
> Be brave and courageous.  
> Yes, wait patiently for the Lord.

David had to write this note to himself. Enemies are surrounding him. Things could go really badly at any moment. There was a lot to worry about. So he put sticky notes all over his mirror or on his steering wheel, with these words on them. David is a bit unsure of how the overall sovereign will of God is supposed to work itself out. He's a little confused, uncertain as to how to go forward. He's not sure what to do. So he waits. He stirs himself to be brave and to wait.

This is where many of us find ourselves in the walk with God as we try to determine the specifics of God's will. Perhaps you want an answer about something, and you know the overall scheme, but you don't know exactly how it is supposed to work out. It's certainly proper, with an emphasis on relationship with God, to proactively wait. If I love a girl ---_and I do! I've been married to her for 22+ years!!_--- , I will wait for her, and even if I'm getting antsy, I will place her at the forefront of my priorities and passions.

But courage in discovering God's will can be difficult sometimes. Like David prays in Psalm 27:9-10:
