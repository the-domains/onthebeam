The Power of ONE

We would like the will of God to bring us answers. But so often the will of God just raises more questions.

* **_What does God want me to do for a career?_**
* **_Is it even possible to go against God's will? _**
* **_Should I marry? Or should I tarry to marry?_**--- Should Harry marry Carrie? Or Should Harry tarry to Marry Carrie? I mean, these are serious questions everyone! God's will isn't always clear to us. Maybe Harry should marry Sherri? It's Very Scary!-- (Come on, Dr. Seuss made millions off of stuff like this.)
* **_Is anybody reading this post anymore?_**--- Sorry, this was a question that I asked in my head. Sorry. That wasn't meant to make it to the public. Sorry.
* **_It is 2:30am. Should I keep watching this Full House marathon?_**--- Certainly it must be in God's will to continue on the binge-athon that is every season of Full House. Yes you have life-changing activities tomorrow but, seriously, what mess will Danny have to clean up next?

You get my point, right? If God's will keeps placing questions before us, then why do we treat God's will like it's supposed to just dispense answers? Perhaps God's will is actually more about the questions, because perhaps the questions spur our desire to know God.

In our anxiety, in our nervous quest to discover**what**God's will is for_my life_or**what**will happen to_me_or**what**decision should_I_make, we tend to emphasize the "What" or the "My Life" portion of the question: What is God's will for my life?

The emphasis to this question, however, shouldn't be on "what" or "my life". The emphasis should be on "God's will". Knowing the will of God is more about knowing God than knowing what action to take or what benefit should befall my life.

> So I guess the question I'm asking would be: who is focus of our motivation to know God's will?

In deciphering what God's will is for our lives we are put in a place where we actually have to pursue God. God's will is less about answers and more about the pursuit of Jesus, the nearness of relationship with him, the desire to live in step his Spirit, the thirst for his Word, alive and living and active. God's will is not so much about finding the answer to our questions as it is about finding God himself and being in relationship with him.
