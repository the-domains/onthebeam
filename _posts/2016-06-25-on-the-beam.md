What is On The Beam?

Ok, so you start a blog and you give it a title. I guess you have to write a post talking about why you picked that blog name, right? Well, if that wasn't a rule of creating a blog I just made it one. So here it comes- what is on the beam? 

A while ago I read "For The Love" by Jen Hatmaker. If you haven't already checked her out, go do yourself a favour and read some of her stuff. She's seriously hilarious and right up my alley. Kind of snarky but has her priorities straight (these are the things I like to think about myself, obviously.) Reading an author who's sarcastic makes me feel better about everything. I swear, if people aren't sarcastic I literally don't know how to relate to them. Actually, I didn't read her book so much as I listened to it on audio book. It was one the best books to get on audio book because she reads it herself so the humour really comes through better. I had it as we drove the coastal highway around San Francisco on a trip in December. Driving in the pouring rain with a sleeping baby in the backseat on the way to Sonoma to do some wine tastings. Yeah, I was in my happy place. 

Fast forward a couple of months. One night after (yet another!) conversation with my husband about how I just didn't know where to start with blogging, I decided to spend my yoga class thinking about a title for my blog. I'm very linear in many ways and I just couldn't unpack the idea of a blog without first knowing the title of it. I laid face down on my mat and thought about w

She talked about the concept of "on the beam" in her book. I'll paraphrase here but basically it was the idea that her daughter's gymnastics class inspired her to think of her life like a balance beam that can only hold so much. The idea is that we all need to be aware of what we are putting on or off our beam. To fully own what we want to have on there and to what we want to throw off unapologetically. 

As I laid face down on my mat thinking about what had I read or been inspired by lately this came immediately to my mind. On the beam. That concept had resonated with me. I feel like it's easy to put things ON the beam but to also be honest with myself about what I was throwing off the beam and just being real about that. Yeah, that was good stuff. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a9669e1d-14c8-433e-9366-1215d9d933e1.jpg)
